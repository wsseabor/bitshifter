#### Bitshifter

This is a browser based vanilla JS app that has fun with bitshifting because I had trouble understanding it
so what was a lowly programmer to do but overengineer something to try and understand it. This is an offshoot
of a project that is emulating a 6502 processor in Python, and with some bit manipulation involved I wanted a
visualizer and description.

Choose between the three main shift operations in either 4, 8, or 16 bit.

Graphic design **is** my passion.

This is way too much.
